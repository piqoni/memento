# Info
[More on my blog](http://piqoni.github.io/memento-quick-launch-your-notes-to-the-clipboard.html)
# Requirements & OS
Tested in Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04 but theoretically should work on other OS as well. Bug reports are welcome.

# Installation
- Git clone or download the project
- Install clipboard dependency
  ``` pip install clipboard ```
# Usage
- Depending on your OS, attach the script execution to a shortcut (`CTRL+~` is a good one)
- Edit the memento.csv file to add your notes. 

Selecting a note will close the application, or pressing `Escape`.
